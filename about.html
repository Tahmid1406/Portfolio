        <h1 class='heading'> <span> A brief biography </span> | My Story</h1>
        <p> Being born among the hills and sea, I was raised among the richness of mother nature. I'm talking about the
        beautiful port city of Bangladesh named Chottogram, where I was born in the year 1998. My father was a government employee
        and being transferred to new places was a part of our life. Although with every transfer I had to leave my school, teachers
        and friends behind, but, I was presented with the opportunity to meet new people, be among a different cultures, adapt 
        to different localities and so on. </p>   

        <p> After finishing my early schooling by the year 2012, I took science as my group of study (based on Bangladesh education system).
        I was always amazed to see how there's science in everything, from a ball point to a space station, from above and beyond! I passed 
        both the Junior (2012) and Secondary (2013) education board exams (publicly held in Bangladesh) with perfect scores of <span class='emphasis'> 5.00/5.00 with
        "talent-pool scholarships" </span> in both of them which was awarded by the Education Ministry of Bangladesh. In the higher secondary 
        education board exams, I again gained a <span class='emphasis'> perfect score of 5.00/5.00 </span>. After passing the HSC, without any second thought, I choose 
        <span class='emphasis'> Computer Science & Engineering  </span> as my subject for higher studies. I still remember the day when the first computer arrived at my house. 
        It had a pentium processor CPU with 64 MB of RAM, CD writter, floppy disk for sharing files and a CRT monitor. It was an amazing
        journey of mine to see computers grow this powerful from those of computers. With great passion, I got admitted to the <span class='emphasis'> Electrical 
        and Computer Engineering department </span> of <span class='emphasis'> North South University</span>, Dhaka which is among the <span class='emphasis'> top ranked (among top 5) universities in 
        Bangladesh</span>. </p>

        <p> University is the place where I met with brilliant minds and passionate people. The four years of my university life have had a 
        great impact on me becoming the person I am today. I had the amazing opportunity to work with people like <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/profile/A-K-M-Bahalul-Haque' target='_blank' class='clickable'>AKM Bahalul Haque</a> sir for 
        my junior design project (CSE299) and directed research (CSE 498R) where I got introduced to academic research. In my final year, I was 
        lucky enough to get <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammad-Rahman-105' target='_blank' class='clickable'> Dr. Mohammad Rashedur Rahman</a> sir as my supervisor for Senior Design Project (CSE499). The 8 month long design project ended 
        with <span class='emphasis'>two peer-reviewed papers</span>. After graduation, I started working as an <span class='emphasis'> Research Assistant under Dr. Rashed </span> and our project has 
        been <span class='emphasis'> funded by North South University</span>. </p>  

        <p> I believe it's essential for every person to do what he loves and to love what he does. So, Finding out a proper purpose to 
        wake up every morning is important to me. Otherwise, it becomes difficult to get things done! I am one of those blessed people 
        who found their purpose of life. As Mr. Elon Musk said,<span class='emphasis'> "When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in 
        your favor"</span>, I truly believe that hardwork and dedication works against all the odds. 
        This is what motivates me and keeps me going. </p>
